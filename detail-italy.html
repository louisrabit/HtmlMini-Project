The Louvre Museum is housed in the Louvre Palace, a 12th-century fortress that has been expanded and renovated on several occasions. 
<br> Before it became a museum, some monarchs such as Carlos V and Felipe II used the palace as a royal residence where they accumulated their artistic collections.

<br> After the transfer of the royal residence to the Palace of Versailles, the impressive building of 160,000 square meters began its transformation process into one of the most important museums in the world.

<br> In 1989 the crystal pyramid was built, breaking the monotony of the large gray blocks of the museum and which currently serves as the access door.
